# Jarvis Discord Bot

A discord bot using discord.py
The bot is designed to work on any server

The bot is an all purpose bot for moderation and games.
Jarvis has auto roles.
All information is stored on mongoDB and a DB would need to be set up to run the bot

### Updates

There will be no more updates added to this project as discord.py no longer is being updated. 
Discord is changing their API structure and eventually bots like this one will no longer work properly
